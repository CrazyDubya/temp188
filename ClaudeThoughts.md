5. Provide Relevant Information: Share necessary context, but avoid overwhelming with irrelevant details.

6. Ask for Explanations: If you want me to explain my reasoning or process, explicitly request it.

7. Specify Output Format: If you need a particular format (e.g., code, markdown, JSON), mention it upfront.

8. Iterate and Refine: Don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions or request clarifications.

12. Use Code Blocks: When discussing code, use markdown code blocks for clarity.

13. Specify Roles: If you want me to assume a particular role (e.g., code reviewer, architect), state it clearly.

14. Request Step-by-Step Instructions: For complex tasks, ask for detailed, sequential steps.

15. Use System Messages: For consistent behavior across conversations, use system messages to set expectations.

23. Include Version Control Info: Mention relevant branch, commit, or version information when discussing code.

24. Discuss Error Handling: Address how to handle errors and edge cases in proposed solutions.

25. Be Mindful of Limitations: Remember that I don't have access to external information or the ability to execute code.
