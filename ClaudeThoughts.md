# ClaudeThoughts: Best Practices for Prompting Claude

1. Be specific and clear: Provide detailed context and clearly state your goals or questions.

2. Use examples: When possible, include examples to illustrate what you're looking for.

3. Break down complex tasks: For large projects, divide them into smaller, manageable steps.

4. Provide relevant information: Share necessary context, but avoid overwhelming with irrelevant details.

5. Ask for explanations: If you want me to explain my reasoning or process, explicitly request it.

6. Specify output format: If you need a particular format (e.g., code, markdown, JSON), mention it upfront.

7. Iterate and refine: Don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions or request clarifications.

8. Be open to suggestions: I might propose alternative approaches; consider them if they seem valuable.

9. Provide feedback: Let me know if my responses are helpful or if adjustments are needed.

10. Maintain context: In ongoing conversations, briefly recap previous points if necessary.

11. Use code blocks: When discussing code, use markdown code blocks for clarity.

12. Specify roles: If you want me to assume a particular role (e.g., code reviewer, architect), state it clearly.

13. Ask for step-by-step instructions: For complex tasks, request detailed, sequential steps.

14. Use system messages: For consistent behavior across conversations, use system messages to set expectations.

15. Be mindful of my limitations: Remember that I don't have access to external information or the ability to execute code.

By following these best practices, you can optimize our interactions and get the most value from our conversations.
