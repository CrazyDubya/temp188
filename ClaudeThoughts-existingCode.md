# ClaudeThoughts: Best Practices for Working with Claude on Existing Codebases

1. Provide Context: Give a brief overview of the existing codebase, including its purpose, main components, and architecture.

2. Share Relevant Code Snippets: When discussing specific parts of the codebase, share the relevant code snippets using markdown code blocks.

3. Explain Code Structure: Describe the file structure, naming conventions, and any design patterns used in the existing code.

4. Highlight Dependencies: Mention key libraries, frameworks, or external dependencies the codebase relies on.

5. Clarify Coding Standards: Inform me about any specific coding standards or style guides followed in the project.

6. Identify Pain Points: Clearly communicate any existing issues, technical debt, or areas that need improvement.

7. Specify Version Information: Provide details about the current version of the code and any version control system used.

8. Describe the Development Environment: Share information about the development environment, build tools, and deployment processes.

9. Explain Existing Tests: Outline the current testing strategy, including types of tests (unit, integration, etc.) and test coverage.

10. Communicate Constraints: Mention any constraints or limitations (e.g., backward compatibility requirements, performance criteria) that solutions must adhere to.

11. Provide Documentation: Share links or excerpts from existing documentation, including inline comments, README files, or external docs.

12. Describe the Modification Goal: Clearly state the objective of the code changes you want to make.

13. Ask for Incremental Changes: For complex modifications, request step-by-step guidance that builds upon the existing code.

14. Request Refactoring Suggestions: Ask for ideas on how to improve code quality or structure while making changes.

15. Seek Integration Advice: Ask how new changes can best integrate with the existing codebase without disrupting current functionality.

16. Discuss Potential Side Effects: Ask about possible unintended consequences of proposed changes on other parts of the system.

17. Request Performance Considerations: Ask for advice on maintaining or improving performance when modifying existing code.

18. Seek Backwards Compatibility Guidance: Ask how to implement changes while maintaining compatibility with older versions if required.

19. Ask for Test Update Suggestions: Request advice on updating or creating new tests to cover the modified code.

20. Discuss Code Review Criteria: Ask about key points to consider when reviewing the changes in the context of the existing codebase.

21. Seek Documentation Update Advice: Ask for suggestions on updating existing documentation to reflect the changes.

22. Request Debugging Strategies: If facing issues, ask for debugging approaches tailored to the existing codebase structure.

23. Discuss Scalability: Ask how proposed changes might affect the scalability of the existing system.

24. Seek Modularization Advice: Request suggestions for improving modularity or extracting reusable components from existing code.

25. Ask About Best Practices: Request advice on how the existing code could better align with current industry best practices.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively leverage my capabilities to work with and improve existing codebases, ensuring that changes are well-integrated, maintainable, and aligned with the overall structure and goals of the project.
