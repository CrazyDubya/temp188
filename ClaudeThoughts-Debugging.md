# ClaudeThoughts: Best Practices for Debugging with Claude

1. Provide Detailed Error Information: Share the full error message, stack trace, and any relevant logs.

2. Describe the Expected Behavior: Clearly explain what the code should do when working correctly.

3. Share the Problematic Code: Provide the relevant code snippets, including the surrounding context.

4. Explain Your Debugging Steps: Describe what you've already tried to solve the issue.

5. Specify the Environment: Share details about your development environment, including OS, language version, and relevant library versions.

6. Use Code Blocks: When sharing code or error messages, use markdown code blocks for clarity.

7. Provide Input and Output Examples: Share sample inputs that trigger the bug and the corresponding outputs.

8. Isolate the Problem: Try to narrow down the issue to the smallest possible code snippet that reproduces the bug.

9. Ask for Step-by-Step Debugging: Request a systematic approach to identifying and fixing the issue.

10. Seek Explanations: Ask for explanations of why the bug is occurring, not just how to fix it.

11. Consider Edge Cases: Discuss potential edge cases or unusual inputs that might be causing the issue.

12. Request Test Cases: Ask for suggestions on test cases that could help identify or prevent similar bugs.

13. Discuss Error Handling: Ask about proper error handling techniques relevant to the bug.

14. Seek Performance Insights: If the bug is performance-related, ask for profiling or optimization suggestions.

15. Ask About Debugging Tools: Seek advice on debugging tools or techniques specific to your language or framework.

16. Request Log Analysis: If logs are available, ask for help interpreting them or suggestions for additional logging.

17. Discuss Potential Side Effects: When considering fixes, ask about possible unintended consequences.

18. Seek Root Cause Analysis: Ask for help identifying the underlying cause, not just treating symptoms.

19. Request Debugging Strategies: Ask for general debugging strategies that could be applied to similar problems in the future.

20. Discuss Code Review: Ask how the bug could have been caught in a code review and what to look for in the future.

21. Seek Refactoring Advice: Ask if refactoring could help prevent similar bugs or make the code more maintainable.

22. Consider Security Implications: If relevant, ask about potential security vulnerabilities related to the bug.

23. Discuss Testing Strategies: Ask how to improve testing to catch this type of bug in the future.

24. Seek Documentation Advice: Ask for suggestions on improving documentation to prevent similar misunderstandings.

25. Request Best Practices: Ask about best practices in coding or architecture that could help avoid similar issues.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively leverage Claude's capabilities to debug issues, understand root causes, and improve overall code quality and reliability.
