4. Include Related Files: If the changes span multiple files, provide all relevant files for a comprehensive review.

5. Highlight Key Changes: Point out the main modifications if reviewing a large diff.

6. Ask Specific Questions: Frame precise questions about particular code sections or decisions.

7. Request Alternatives: Ask Claude to suggest alternative implementations if applicable.

8. Seek Optimization Tips: Ask for potential performance improvements or code optimizations.

9. Check for Best Practices: Request an assessment of how well the code follows industry best practices and design patterns.

10. Validate Error Handling: Ask Claude to review error handling and edge case coverage.

11. Assess Testability: Request feedback on the code's testability and suggestions for test cases.

12. Review Documentation: Ask Claude to evaluate inline comments and suggest improvements.

13. Consider Scalability: Request an analysis of how well the code would scale.

14. Check for Security Issues: Ask Claude to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

15. Evaluate Modularity: Request feedback on the code's modularity and reusability.

16. Assess Naming Conventions: Ask for an evaluation of variable, function, and class names.

17. Review Code Style: Request a check on adherence to the project's coding style guidelines.

18. Seek Refactoring Advice: Ask for suggestions on how to refactor complex sections.

19. Validate API Design: If applicable, request a review of API design principles.

20. Check for Consistency: Ask Claude to evaluate consistency with the rest of the codebase.
